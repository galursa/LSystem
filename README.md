# LSystem
## Program for drawing figures using L-system
The program was made for drawing fractal sets and other sets or figures using 2D turtle graphic for L-system. 
It to draw plain L-system  and branched L-system (with this the size of the stack is limited therefore we can generate and draw limited structures).
It gives possibility to define meaning of extra symbols.
There are examples of files with this system, therefore someome who don't know how to define complete L-system can use these example.
